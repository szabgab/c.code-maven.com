# The C programming language
---

The C programming language is probably the oldest language that is still very popular. According to the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) it is number 3
It was surpassed by [C++](https://cpp.code-maven.com/) only recently.
According to [PYPL - PopularitY of Programming Language](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) C and C++ (measured as one language???) are on the 5th place.
The [Stack Overflow 2023 survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) puts C as the 13th most desired language
(including HTML/CSS and SQL before it).

Checked on June 18, 2024.


I learned C at the university and I have not used it since, but I think it will be interesting to learn it. Again.


I think I am going to read (again) the 2nd edition of the [The C Programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) and I might make notes as well.
My primary computer runs Ubuntu Linux and thus some aspects of what I learn and write about will be probably more relevant for that OS. Once in a while I might launch a VirtualBox to run MS Windows
and try something there too.
