# Single-line and multi-line comments in the code

Add comments to the code

C Allows us to add comments to the code in two ways.

A single-line comment start with `//` and ends at the end of the current line.

A multi-line comment starts with `/*`   and ends on some later line with `*/`.

This can be used to add explanation to the developers and maintainers of the code and also to temporarily disable some of the code.

```c
{{#include examples/comments/comments.c }}
```

```
$ gcc comments.c
$ ./a.out
Hello World!
```



    //
    '/*'
